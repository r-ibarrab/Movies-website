# Movies website

Full movies page created with an express server, vainilla javascript and html.

With this project i wanted to practice my nodejs skills. This project is basically a website that is served by an express server, that show a list of movies that are stored in a json (dummy.js). In the frontend side, it loads the movies in groups of 8 and shows them in the screen.
